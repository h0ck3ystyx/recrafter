Suggested Features for Migration AidTo enhance the app for website migration to Crafter CMS, consider these optional features that can be implemented as extensions or flags:Dynamic Content Handling: Use headless browser integration (e.g., playwright or selenium) to render JavaScript-heavy pages and capture fully loaded DOM. This is crucial for single-page apps (SPAs) or sites with dynamic elements.
Content Classification: Leverage machine learning (e.g., via scikit-learn or pre-trained models) to classify page types automatically, suggesting Crafter CMS templates (e.g., "landing page" vs. "detail page").
Component Extraction: Parse CSS/JS to identify reusable components, exporting them as separate files or JSON descriptors for direct import into Crafter's component library.
SEO and Metadata Preservation: Extract and store SEO elements (e.g., canonical URLs, OpenGraph tags) in a dedicated metadata file to recreate in CMS.
Form and Interaction Mapping: Detect forms (e.g., contact or signup) and suggest integrations (e.g., with HubSpot or Crafter's form builder).
Diff and Comparison Tool: A sub-command to compare crawled data with an existing CMS site, highlighting differences for migration validation.
API Export: Expose the stored data via a simple REST API (e.g., using flask) for real-time access by AI tools during template generation.
Authentication Support: Handle basic auth, cookies, or API keys for protected sites, configurable via CLI.
Incremental Crawling: Support resuming crawls or updating only changed pages for ongoing migrations.
Visualization: Generate a graph visualization of the site structure (e.g., using networkx and matplotlib) to aid in understanding hierarchy for CMS modeling.
